<p>I am a generalist programmer currently based in Washington, D.C., working remotely. I most recently lived in Oakland, CA for about seven years. I have a strong interest in distributed systems, design, data visualization, and mapping. My personal interests also center around technology, multimedia art, education, and progressive politics. I previously worked as a teacher in the Oakland Public School District and volunteered at various multimedia-arts/music/technology centers for at-risk youth. In my spare time, I enjoy practicing photography, carpentry, and playing recreational soccer.</p>
