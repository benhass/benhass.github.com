<p>I am a generalist programmer based in the Bay Area and I specialize in full-stack Ruby and JavaScript development. For four years I've worked as a freelance contractor with UC Berkeley and a few non-profit organizations. I am a well-rounded professional - fully capable in design, prototyping, programming and general systems administration.</p>

<p>I'm continually exploring new technologies in my spare time and I have a strong interest in data visualization and mapping, as shown in my work. My interests center around technology, multimedia art, education, and progressive politics. I previously worked as a teacher in the Oakland Public School District and at Media Enterprise Alliance, a youth media organization in Oakland, where I taught multimedia-arts, music, and technology.</p>

<p>I am currently seeking employment at a small to mid-sized company (roughly 20-500 employees).</p>
